				<p>During my first year as a User Experience Design student, I attended a five-day programming bootcamp where I learned how to work with Processing. Each day, we were assigned a different challenge.</p>
				<br>
				<p>This is one of the games I created with Processing. You can control the ball with your arrow keys. The goal is to get the ball to cross the finish line without crashing into the moving obstacles. If you crash into one of the obstacles, you lose a life. You have three lives.</p>

			<div class="bubbles-text">
				<p>Another one of the challenges we got during programming bootcamp was to create an interactive image that incorporates several dynamic patterns. The interactive image had to be able to react to user actions (e.g. it could react to the mouse position, the speed of the mouse movement, mouse clicks, sound, key presses, the speed in which keys are pressed, etc.). Play the video to see what I created!</p>
				<br>
				<p>If you press your mouse, bubbles will appear. The bubbles that appear have random colors and sizes each time you press your mouse. Depending on the position of your mouse, the color of the dots in the background also change.</p>
