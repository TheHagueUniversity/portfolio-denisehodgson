					<p  class="project-content">I have always admired photography. In my free time, I enjoy walking around with my DSLR camera and taking photos along the way. Also, being able to completely transform a photo with an editing software, such as Lightroom CC, is an activity I could spend hours doing. Here are some of the more recent photographs I have taken.</p>

					<p class="project-content">During my first year studying User Experience Design at The Hague University of Applied Sciences, I got the opportunity to work with a client, Hallmark. I got paired up with one of my classmates to tackle the project. We were assigned to design an intangible gift-giving experience that contained three parts; a card personalization tool, a personalized card, and a digital unwrapping.</p>

					<p class="project-content">Another one of the assignments I got during my first year as a User Experience Design student was to create an app for our Design and Creativity course. This app would be a sort of personalized toolbox that contained everything I learned about 'creative thinking' during the course.</p>
